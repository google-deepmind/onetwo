"""Implementation of a Python Planning strategy using the Agent framework.

In the Python Planning strategy, we iteratively prompt an LLM to generate blocks
of Python code, which may include calls to "tools" that are provided in the form
of functions. In each step, the LLM is shown the results of executing the
previous steps, so that the LLM can either build on the previously generated
code (in case of success), or else correct errors that became apparent from the
execution results.

Inspired by various research in Python-based tool orchestration, such as
ViperGPT (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08128.pdf) and AdaPlanner
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16653.pdf)

Adopting the "Agent" framework for the strategy implementation means that:
* The full state of the strategy at each step is encapsulated in a
  serializable state object (PythonPlanningState), which in this case is
  represented as a series of steps, each of which involve generation and
  execution of a Python program.
* The prompt template that defines the calls made to the LLM in each step takes
  such a state object as input and performs exactly one step of the strategy.
  The step-loop is implemented in the agent code, rather than in the prompt
  template.
* This ensures that in addition to running the full Python Planning strategy
  end-to-end, we are also able to support stop/restart, stepwise execution, and
  composition of Python Planning with other agent strategies such as beam search
  for pursuing multiple possible trajectories in parallel.
