    Args:
      timeout: Amount of time after which `PythonSandbox.run` should time out.
      imports: Additional import statements to run at the start of the sandbox
        (on top of any libraries the sandbox imports by default), represented as
        either a list (e.g.,  `['import re', 'from typing import Optional']`) or
        as a block of text (e.g., "import re\nfrom typing import Optional").
        Note that depending on the sandbox implementation, there may be
        limitations regarding what libraries can be imported (see the individual
        sandbox's docstring for details). If an unsupported import statement is
        specified, then `create_sandbox` should ideally detect this proactively
        and raise a ValueError. If the invalid import could not be detected
        proactively (or if the import itself was valid, but usage of certain of
        the imported functions is not allowed), then the issue may alternatively
        manifest itself as a SANDBOX_ERROR when the first problematic code is
        actually run.
      hooks: Mapping from string to functions for the hooks the sandbox can
        call.
      hook_objects: Objects containing modifiable state of the hook functions.
        Takes the form of a mapping of variable name to value. By default, this
        is empty, but users of the sandbox are free to use this as a way to
        bundle together with the sandbox some instances of objects whose life
        cycle they want to have bound together with that of the sandbox, and
        whose contents can be modified by the hook functions. One typical usage
        pattern would be in the case where one of the hooks is a method of an
        object -- in that case, we can store the object itself here. (See usage
        example above.)
      allow_restarts: Set True to return a sandbox that continues accepting
        requests after a restart. Only select this option if you don't expect
        multiple calls to [safe_]run() to depend on each other.
