"""Library for making batched functions and methods with decorators.

In this file we use words `request` and `reply` to mean function (or method)
inputs and outputs respectively.

# Usage:

## Decorate a function

```
@batch_function(batch_size=10)
def my_function(requests: Sequence[_RequestT]) -> Sequence[_ReplyT]:
  ...

# my_function should be now awaited.
async def wrapper():
  res = []
  for req in requests:
    result = await my_function([req])
    res.append(result)
  return res

results = run(wrapper())
```
The execution will automatically become asynchronous and will happen only when
the batches are full or if there are no more calls.
These calls can be made in arbitrary asynchronous programs.


## Decorate a method

In the case of a method, the arguments passed to the decorator can depend on
other attributes or methods of the same class. This would be indicated with
`FromInstance('param_name')` which indicates which parameter (or method) is
to be used for the value of that argument at runtime.
In addition, it is required that the class itself has batching enabled as it
will need to create queues possibly for each different instance from that class.
This is done with the `@add_batching` decorator.

```
@add_batching
class SomeClass:
  my_batch_size: int

  @batch_method(batch_size=FromInstance('my_batch_size'))
  def my_method(requests: Sequence[_RequestT]) -> Sequence[_ReplyT]:
    ...

# my_method should be now awaited.
async def wrapper():
  res = []
  for req in requests:
    result = await SomeClass().my_method([req])
    res.append(result)
  return res

results = run(wrapper())
```

## Batching function (batching_function)

One parameter that can be passed to the decorators is a batching function.
It helps to compose batches out of multiple separate calls to the function  (or
method). Assuming we have a function `my_fn(a, b)` that takes certain arguments,
batching_function decides whether a new request `my_fn(a=1, b='bla')` (expressed
as `request = {'a':1, 'b':'bla}`) can be appended to the already existing batch
`batch = (req`, re2, ...)` of requests (i.e. whether the new request is
"compatible" with other requests in the batch) and whether the batch is full (or
will be full after appending a new request). The notion of "compatible" can be
different between the use cases. User has an option of not specifying
batching_function. In that case use must specify the batch_size and default
batching mechanism is used, where any requests are assumed compatible and we add
new requests to the batch as long as batch_size has not been reached.

## Separate the call and implementation

Another decorator is provided to separate specifying the signature of the
function to be called with a single request, and the implementation of the
function that processes a list of requests.
The reason to have this is when registering the function to be used in the rest
of the code, it is preferable to register the function that takes parameters
for a single request, so that the rest of the code will not have to know that
there is batching happening, and what will be exposed is directly the signature
of how to provide one request instead of a list-of-dict signature.

In particular, the code may have calls of the `single_function` (see example
below) peppered throughout, some of which may be wrapped in loops at various
levels, some may be in different coroutines, etc... and all these calls would
end up being batched automatically, and what would be called eventually is the
`my_batch_function`.

```
# `implementation` should point to a function decorated with `batch_function`.
@batchable_function(implementation=my_batch_function)
def single_function(a: int, b: str):
  # No implementation needed, this simply dictates the signature.
  pass

@batch_function(batch_size=10)
def my_batch_function(requests: Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]):
  # Actually implement the processing in batches.
  # Requests are passed as a Sequence of dict of {arg_name: arg_value}.

# Now in the rest of the code, my_batch_function does not have to be called, and
# one can just use single_function everywhere, as it would only always send one
# request at a time (the batching would happen automatically when possible).
# Note that the single_function must be awaited, as it is now a coroutine
# (allowing asynchronous execution hence batching).

...
result = await single_function(a=1, b='z')
...
result = await single_function(a=2, b='a')
```

## Debug

An additional parameter can be passed to the `@batch_function` and
`@batch_method` decorators: `debug=True`. This indicates that the calls to the
underlying batch function should be stored for debugging purposes.

TODO: Currently it is pretty complicated to access the underlying
queue from the decorated functions (see batching_test.py). Ideally there should
be a uniform and straightforward mechanism.

  Using this decorator will add an attribute `threadpools` to the class, which

  one threadpool created for each decorated method and each instance of the
