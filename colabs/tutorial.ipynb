        "\n",
        "One of the key principles behind the OneTwo library is to enable the creation of complex flows involving several calls to foundation models and possibly other tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "We facilitate through functionality at two levels:\n",
        "* **OneTwo Core:** Low-level libraries for connecting to models, prompting them, and constructing programs that chain multiple calls to such models, while leaving you full flexibility in the structuring of your program (just like if you were programming in pure Python).\n",
        "* **OneTwo Standard Library:** A set of reusable components built on top of the OneTwo Core, providing generic implementations of a wide range of SOTA prompting strategies from Google DeepMind, Google Research, and published research from outside of Google.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this overview, we provide a quick introduction to both the OneTwo core and the OneTwo standard library, with the intention that with the overview alone, you should already be up and running with OneTwo in less than an hour. Feel free to then continue on with the advanced sections, or come back to them later!\n",
        "\n",
        "**OneTwo Core**\n",
        "\n",
        "For ease of experimentation, it is important to easily change the backends or their configuration and run the same flow on two backends/configurations, e.g. when doing comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bottleneck is often the multiple RPC requests that need to happen. This makes fast iterations or experimenting on many examples slow and tedious. In order to reduce this bottleneck, there are two strategies that are implemented in the OneTwo library:\n",
        "1. **Caching**: The result of the calls to the models are cached, which enables one to very quickly replay a flow or an experiment which may have partially executed (e.g. failed in the middle of execution). For example, if you have a complex flow and want to add just one extra step, rerunning the whole thing amounts to reading everything from cache and only executing for real that one last step.\n",
        "1. **Asynchronous Execution**: While some of the model calls might need to be chained serially, there are many situations when you may want to execute some calls in parallel (e.g. talking to different backends, running an experiment on many examples, or having a step in your flow where several independent tasks are performed). A natural way to do that is to use asynchronous programming, or multi-threading.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first several sub-sections of the overview, we provide an introduction that illustrates how to connect to and prompt a model using the basic OneTwo functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**OneTwo Standard Library:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the later sub-sections of the overview, we introduce some of the most widely used components from the OneTwo standard library, including bread-and-butter techniques such as chain-of-thought and self-consistency, as well as more complex agent and tool use strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "More details on the OneTwo standard library and other advanced features are provided in additional sections after the overview."

Rather than higher computational cost through computation of longer sequences, however, self-consistency invests additional computational cost in the form of parallel processing.\n",

This has the effect of estimating a probability distribution over final answers, while marginalizing over the many possible reasoning paths that could potentially lead to the same answer. Empirically, this has been found to lead to double-digit improvements in accuracy on many tasks.\n",

As a convenience, however, OneTwo also provides a generic implementation of self-consistency in the form of the `SelfConsistency` strategy, which can be used to wrap an arbitrary underlying strategy. Below we show how use this to wrap an underlying chain-of-thought strategy, like in the original paper."

        "Sometimes if you cancel a call to `ot.run` or related function in the middle of its execution via repeatedly clicking \"Interrupt Execution\" or through repeated keyboard interrupts, you can end up with orphaned pending entries left over in the cache. These pending entries are stored internally in a `calls_in_progress` field of the cache handler, which serves an important role during execution, but can lead to problems if orphaned entries are carried over from one run to another. Normally you should not need to worry about this, as the `calls_in_progress` field is normally cleared automatically at the end of each run, both in the case where the run succeeded and in the case where it was interrupted due to an exception or keyboard interrupt. If you press interrupt repeatedly, however, it may end up interrupting the logic that cleans up things like `calls_in_progress`, in which case you may see a non-zero value for `calls_in_progress` in the diagnostics above. In this case, you can forcibly clear the `calls_in_progress` by temporarily uncommenting and executing the line below."
